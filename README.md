# sha256

## Description

A C++ implementation of the SHA256 message digest algorithm heavily inspired by the Wikipedia (as per y2022-m06-d19) implementation found at

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2

This implementation does not allocate data on the heap while processing.

## Note

I can not vouch for the correctness of the implementation of the algorithm.

Untested on big endian architectures.
